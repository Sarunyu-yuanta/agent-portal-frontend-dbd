/**
 * Downloads the real promotion artwork from Yuanta's CMS into `public/campaigns`.
 *
 * The ten promotions in `src/data/campaigns.json` are transcribed from
 * yuanta.co.th/promotion, so their covers come from the same place rather than
 * from `generate-campaign-covers.mjs`: a drawn gradient behind a campaign whose
 * copy is verbatim reads as a placeholder next to the real banner the client
 * will have already seen on the public site.
 *
 * The events have no public counterpart and keep their generated SVGs — the two
 * scripts divide by that line, and each refuses to touch the other's files:
 * this one writes only `.webp`, the generator only `.svg`.
 *
 * **Why resize.** The upstream banners are print-weight — one is 4500×2354 at
 * 15 MB — and the card crops them to a 16:9 thumbnail. Each is refitted to
 * 960×540, the same frame the generated covers use, which is what keeps the
 * grid from pulling 20 MB to paint ten cards.
 *
 * The output is committed. This is a one-off authoring tool, not a build step —
 * re-run it only after adding a promotion to the fixture:
 *
 *     npm run covers:fetch
