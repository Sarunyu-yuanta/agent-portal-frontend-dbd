/**
 * The one order store for the whole app — bookings, the requests sent to
 * clients, and the orders sent downstream.
 *
 * Mounted once in the dashboard layout, for the same reason `NotesProvider` is:
 * a booking placed from a product page has to show up on `/orders` and in the
 * header bell without either of them remounting. The layout does not remount
 * between pages, so state held here survives navigation where `useState` in a
 * page would not.
 *
 * ─── Backend handoff ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Held in React state, seeded from `lib/order-mock-data`. Two things here stand
 * in for systems that do not exist yet, and both are marked:
 *
 * 1. **{@link REQUIREMENT_TURNAROUND_MS}** — a client finishing their forms in
 *    another system. Really a webhook, or a poll of that system.
 * 2. **{@link SUBMISSION_TURNAROUND_MS}** — the back office accepting an order.
 *    Really a status on the order record, arriving the same way.
 * 3. **{@link BACKOFFICE_PICKUP_MS}** — the back office taking an order up:
 *    collecting a basket book that has filled, or starting on a bond order the
 *    IC has sent. Really a job on their side, or a webhook this app receives;
 *    either way nobody here presses anything.
 *
 * Every mutator is `async` and every call site awaits it, so pointing them at
 * real endpoints is a change in this file alone. `isLoading` is in the contract
 * and permanently `false` for the same reason `useStatic` returns one — the
 * screens already render skeletons against it.
