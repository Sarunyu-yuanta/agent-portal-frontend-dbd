/**
 * Everything the IC *does* on a campaign: what has been sent to whom, who is
 * registered for which event, and who turned up.
 *
 * Mounted once in the dashboard layout, for the same reason `OrdersProvider`
 * is: a share sent from `/promotions/cmp-dr-qqqm19` has to move the
 * "ลูกค้าที่เข้าเงื่อนไขแต่ยังไม่ได้ชวน" tile on `/promotions` without either
 * screen remounting, and the layout is the only thing that doesn't.
 *
 * ─── Backend handoff ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Held in React state, seeded from `lib/campaign-mock-data`. Every mutator is
 * `async` and awaited at every call site, so pointing them at real endpoints is
 * a change in this file alone. `isLoading` is in the contract and permanently
 * `false` for the same reason `useStatic` returns one — the screens already
 * render skeletons against it.
 *
 * Three rules are enforced here rather than in the views, because this is where
 * the endpoint will enforce them:
 *
 * 1. **Only an approved material can be shared.** {@link shareMaterial} throws
 *    on anything else. The UI also disables those rows, but a disabled button
 *    is a courtesy, not a control.
 * 2. **A closed campaign takes no shares.** Same reasoning: the cards and the
 *    detail page both grey out, and this is what makes that true rather than
 *    merely drawn.
 * 3. **Every share writes a {@link ShareLog}.** The per-client status is
 *    updated *alongside* the log, never instead of it — the log is the
 *    compliance record and is append-only.
