            therefore ring them*. Split across lines they were two separate
            right-aligned things the reader had to join back up.

            It also buys line two its full width back — the Margin Call row had
            been losing its account number to truncation to make room for a
            deadline it did not need to share a line with.

            Not the tick this row used to carry. That one *disposed* of a
            finding — acknowledging a compliance alert from a list you are
            skimming is exactly the reflex to design against, and it still
            lives behind the detail panel where the figures and the rule are.
            This one *starts* the work the finding is asking for: ring the
            client, or hand it to Compliance. Getting that wrong costs a phone
            call; getting the other one wrong closes a margin call nobody
            looked at.

            `primary`, the same variant the detail panel's footer wears: a list
            whose only filled control is the one that starts the work is a list
            that says what to do with it. The severities keep their own voice —
            tints behind a glyph and inside a small Tag, never solid blue — so
            the two read as different registers rather than competing.

            `stopPropagation` because the row around it is itself a button: a
            click here must not also open the sheet behind the toast. */}

              — the corner being where a row is left, and a filled shape being
              what stops it reading as a third line of text after the finding
              above it.

              `translate-*`, not negative margins, to reach past the row's
              `p-3`. A margin would take those twelve pixels out of the row's
              height, so every row carrying a deadline would come out shorter
              than its neighbours; a transform moves the painted box and leaves
              the layout alone. It also keeps the pill a real flex item, so the
              button can never grow under it the way it could if this were
              positioned absolutely.

              Square but for the top-left: the two edges that meet the row's
              own edges stay flat, which is what makes it read as set into the
              corner rather than floating near it.

              The tint is `deadlineToneClass`'s business and answers *how
              close*, not how bad: red for today, amber for everything else,
              whatever the finding's severity is. The countdown glyph rides
              inside it, marking the figure as a deadline rather than another
              timestamp. */}
