 * - **zone** — a margin call acknowledged while it was `thisWeek` returns at

 *   a force sell, on the app's existing urgency axis rather than a new one.
 *
 * `nodate` and `far` are kept apart: a finding with no deadline never escalates
 * along that axis at all, while one more than 15 days out eventually will, and
 * collapsing them would make a distant Suitability review un-returnable.

 * twelve days left.
 *
 * `daysLeft ?? 0` reads a missing deadline as **now, not never**. A mule flag
 * has no deadline because nobody set one, not because it can wait; dropping it
 * to the bottom of its severity band is the reading that gets it missed.
 *
 * No horizon is applied. `buildQueue` cuts at 15 days because the bell has to
 * stop somewhere a reader would still call "soon"; this list is ranked by how
 * bad a thing is, and a critical finding does not stop mattering because its
 * deadline happens to be three weeks out.
