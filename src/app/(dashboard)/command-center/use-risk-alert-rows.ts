/**
 * Every risk finding across the book, ranked, with the acknowledgement store
 * attached.
 *
 * One definition rather than one per surface — the Command Center card and
 * `/command-center/risk-alerts` both need the same four pieces wired together
 * (the feed, the privacy flag that masks the names, the stored set, and a way
 * to write to it), and two wirings is exactly how one of them quietly stops
 * honouring an acknowledgement. `use-nba-rows` exists for the same reason, and
 * only after the two surfaces had already diverged.
 *
 * Acknowledgement is held in preferences rather than in a context because it is
 * a set of ids and nothing more. `useStoredIds` is `useSyncExternalStore` over
 * `localStorage` with a `storage` listener, so acknowledging on the full page
 * moves the card without a remount — and does so in another tab, which a React
 * context cannot. The one thing that would force a context is "รับทราบ" having
 * to record *who* and *when* for the compliance audit log; that is a server
 * record, and when it lands this is the file that changes.
