/**
 * Search in the open, the four narrowing axes behind a button.
 *
 * They used to sit inline as five controls across the top of the list, which
 * cost a whole band of the page to a thing the IC sets once and then reads
 * past. Search stays out — it is typed at, constantly, and hiding it would be
 * the wrong trade — but product, status, segment and format now live in a
 * dialog.
 *
 * Two consequences the design has to answer, because hiding controls is not
 * free:
 *
 * 1. **You can't see what's applied.** So anything active comes back as a
 *    removable chip under the row. The button carries a count as well, for the
 *    moment the chips have scrolled off.
 * 2. **You can't see the list while you choose.** So the dialog holds a *draft*
 *    rather than applying live — committing on every keystroke would be
 *    rewriting a list nobody can see — and its primary action previews how many
 *    campaigns the draft would leave, so an IC can tell they are about to
 *    filter down to nothing before they close it.
