/**
 * Every reminder this tab lists.
 *
 * ## Two sources, two different reaches
 *
 * `groupDayItems` treats its rows differently and the difference is the shape
 * of this list. A note carries its own `reminderAt`, so one call returns every
 * note reminder whatever month it is anchored to. The market and desk feeds are
 * asked for a month at a time (see `mock-market-feed`), so the anchor decides
 * how much of them comes back — hence the three passes, and hence notes being
 * passed only on the first, where they have already all arrived.
 *
 * An earlier version walked three months either way. It produced 224 rows for
 * 32 facts: the mock generates its seeds *into* whichever month it is asked
 * for, so "SET Outlook 2027" came back seven times under seven ids, and they
 * could not be deduplicated because they are genuinely different rows. Against
 * a real feed a wider window would be real history — but a screen that reads as
 * seven copies of itself is not something to ship on that promise.
 *
 * ## Nothing is filtered out
 *
 * A tempting rule is to keep only the rows that name a client, which would cut
 * this list by two thirds. It is the wrong rule: today's single row on the
 * Dashboard card is `XN : LHHOTEL`, which no one in the book holds, and a
 * "ดูทั้งหมด" that lands on a list missing the row you were looking at is worse
 * than a long list. The card and this tab read the same data, so they agree by
 * construction rather than by luck.
 *
 * Ticked-off reminders stay too. The card asks the narrower question, what is
 * still owed, so it drops them. This tab is the record: the reminder you
 * finished last week is the one you go looking for when someone asks whether it
 * was done, and a list that quietly omits it cannot answer that.
 *
 * ## KYC expiries are here, on their expiry day
 *
 * They are not calendar rows — `day-items` deliberately keeps its three sources
 * closed, and a KYC date is derived from the client's record rather than
 * written on a day. But on a list of dated things it is the same kind of thing:
 * a deadline that passes whether or not anyone looks. The header bell has
 * merged the two feeds for exactly that reason, and so does the Dashboard's
 * queue; this is the third surface to reach the same conclusion.
 *
 * Ungated, unlike the Dashboard's card. That one applies the bell's checkpoint
 * and its 15-day horizon, because it is asking "what is ringing this morning".
 * This tab asks "what falls on which day", and a date does not stop being a
 * date because it is still three weeks out — so client 110002, twenty-five days
 * away and invisible on the Dashboard, has a row here.
