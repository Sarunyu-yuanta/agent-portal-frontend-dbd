 * the position doesn't: how much attention the day is still owed. Today is
 * solid and reads first, the days ahead are a light tint, and what's behind you
 * is washed out — present but no longer competing.
 *

 * taxonomy (see `market-taxonomy`), which is a fact about what they are rather
 * than about when they are, and the two cannot share a hue channel. They keep
 * the "behind you" half of this idea through {@link PAST_FADE} and give up the

 * is scanning the month for and its distance from today is already the column

    {/* Mounted for the whole time the viewport is a phone, not only while open:
        `BottomSheet` is a vaul drawer and plays its own slide-out off the `open`
        prop, so unmounting on close would cut the animation. It renders nothing
        until first opened.

        `px-0 pb-0` rather than the sheet's own `px-4 pb-6` — the day list draws
        full-bleed section rules and row hovers, and the footer already sets its
        own bottom padding around the home indicator. `flex min-h-0 flex-col` on
        the content is what lets the list scroll: the sheet caps itself at 80vh,
        and a long day only stays inside that cap if the box between the two can
        shrink. No header, because the content leads with its own date and
        weekday — the design system's would be a second title above it. */}
