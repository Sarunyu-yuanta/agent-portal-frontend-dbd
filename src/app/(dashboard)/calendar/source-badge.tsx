/**
 * The mark a row leads with, so a reader can tell "something I wrote" from
 * "something the exchange published" from "something the desk put up" before
 * reading a word of it.
 *
 * One definition, read by every surface that lists day items — the Calendar's
 * day panel, the alert panel, a client's Reminders tab, the Dashboard queue and
 * the header bell. It started out inline in the day list and was copied into
 * the panel, which is exactly how the two drifted apart: the panel stayed green
 * for a release after the list turned orange.
 *
 * ## Why this is a function and not a table
 *
 * It used to be a `Record<DayItemSource, …>`, back when the two sources were
 * "note" and "dividend" and a source was the whole of what a row's colour had
 * to say. It isn't any more. A corporate action's colour is its SET code and a
 * market event's is its category, and neither list is closed — see
 * `market-taxonomy`. A table keyed by source could only have answered with one
 * orange for every code, which is the same as answering with nothing.
 *
 * So the tint arrives as an inline `style` rather than a Tailwind class. That
 * is not a style the app can hard-code: the whole point is that a kind nobody
 * has designed for still gets one.
