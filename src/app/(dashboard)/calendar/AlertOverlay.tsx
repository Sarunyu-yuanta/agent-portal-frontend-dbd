 * Its own component because four places open these now — the Calendar grid, a
 * client's Reminders tab, their Overview card and the header bell — and the
 * last time a piece of this was written out twice, the two copies drifted (the
 * source badge stayed green in one after the other turned orange). One
 * definition, so there is nothing to keep in step.
 *
 * ## Two destinations, decided here
 *
 * - A **corporate action** opens the exchange's record sheet: the X-date, the
 *   dividend per share, the payment date. No holders — it is a fact about a
 *   company, and the desk's interest in who holds the symbol is what decided
 *   whether to raise it at all, not part of the record. Same dialog the Company
 *   Events tab on a stock opens, so one action reads identically wherever it is
 *   reached from.
 * - **Anything else** — a seminar, a campaign — opens `AlertDetail`: a sheet on
 *   a phone, a centred panel on a pointer device, with the clients it concerns
 *   spelled out. There the list is the point; "who is this for" is the question
 *   you open a desk event to answer.
 *
 * Deciding it here rather than at each call site is what keeps the four
 * surfaces honest: they all hand over a `DayItem` and get whichever surface
 * that item deserves.
