/**
 * What a desk event opens into.
 *
 * Read-only, because nothing here is the user's to edit — the desk scheduled
 * the seminar, but its date and its invitee list arrive with the event rather
 * than being written on this screen. What it offers that a note doesn't is the
 * part that matters for an event: the people, spelled out. In the day list they
 * are an avatar stack, which answers "roughly who" in the space of three
 * circles; the point of opening one is to get from "roughly who" to a list you
 * can work down.
 *
 * **Corporate actions no longer come here.** They open the exchange's record
 * sheet instead — see `AlertOverlay`, which routes — because an XD is a fact
 * about a company and a list of the people who happen to hold it is not part of
 * that record.
 *
 * Two states, not two surfaces: the list, and one person's contact details
 * (`HolderContact`). Both live in whatever shell the caller opened — a modal on
 * a pointer device, a sheet on a phone — so Back returns to the event rather
 * than to the page.
 *
 * Names go through `maskName`, the way every other client name in the app does
 * when privacy mode is on. A list of full names is a much louder leak than the
 * initials on an avatar, so this is the one place in the Calendar where the
 * setting has to be honoured.

          Two provenances now, not one. "The system raised this" was true when
