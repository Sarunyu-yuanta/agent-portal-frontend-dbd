/**
 * The header bell's reminder rows and click targets — every client's reminders,
 * plus the corporate actions and desk events that land on somebody in the book,
 * tagged with the zone each one falls in. Lifted out
 * of the app-shell layout: this is a self-contained "day items in, notification
 * rows out" computation with no dependency on page chrome.
 *
 * Returns rows rather than groups. The shell merges them with the KYC feed and
 * groups the combined list once, so both sources share one ordering — see
 * `@/app/(dashboard)/notification-zones`.
 *
 * A reminder stays in whichever zone it currently falls in until it crosses
 * into the next one, so one that rang at 15 days out doesn't go quiet until 7
 * and read as though it had been dealt with in between.
