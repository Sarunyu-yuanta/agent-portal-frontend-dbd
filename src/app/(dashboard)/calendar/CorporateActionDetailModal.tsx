 * the Calendar page itself. Its props are a record rather than that page's own
 * `CorporateCalendarMarker` for the same reason — two callers holding different
 * shapes, one dialog, and the dialog only ever needed four things.
 *
 * **No holders, deliberately.** A corporate action is a fact about a company.
 * The desk knows which clients hold the symbol (the feed carries them, see
 * `market-feed`) and uses it to decide whether to raise the action at all, but
 * a list of people has no place on the exchange's record of an event — the
 * question this sheet answers is "what exactly is happening to this security",
 * and every row in it is about the security.
