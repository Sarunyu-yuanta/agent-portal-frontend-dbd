 * "AI Next Best Actions", held behind a blur until the feature is live.

 * One definition rather than one per surface. The Dashboard shows it across the
 * whole book; a client's Overview shows the same card scoped to that client,
 * and the only thing that differs between them is the sentence on the panel —
 * so that is the only thing this takes as a prop.
 *
 * Held behind a blur rather than replaced by a placeholder: the rows are real
 * enough to show the shape of the thing — a client, a reason, a drafted message
 * — and a reader who can see that shape understands the promise in a way an
 * empty card never conveys. Legible as layout, unreadable as content, which is
 * the honest position for something that is not live yet.
