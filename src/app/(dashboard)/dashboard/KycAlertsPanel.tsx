 * rounded square at the head of a row is precisely what a person's row wears

 * marks this row is that it is *unlike* the others: no face, no second line,
 * text starting where their faces start.
 *
 * A caret, not a countdown pill: every other row's right-hand side is a
 * deadline, and this row is a door. The deadline moves into the sentence
 * instead, in the same colour the pills above use — grey read as "nothing much
 * down here", which is a claim this row is not in a position to make. Against
 * today's data the two on show are ten days over and due today, and the first
