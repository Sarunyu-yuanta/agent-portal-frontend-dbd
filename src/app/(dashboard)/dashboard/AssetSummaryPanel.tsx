/**
 * What the desk's book is made of.
 *
 * Deliberately the only money on this page, and deliberately the last thing on
 * it. "How is the quarter going" is not the question being asked at eight in
 * the morning, and Client 360 owns the answer — but a dashboard that never says
 * what it is managing is missing its subject, so the book gets one card you
 * scroll to rather than a strip you open onto.
 *
 * Idle cash is not here even though it is one line away in `getClientTotals`.
 * It is ฿328M — 12.4% of the book — while the donut's `เงินสด` slice reads 34%,
 * because they are different things: money waiting to be deployed versus the
 * cash sleeve of an allocation model. Two cash figures 200px apart, differing
 * threefold, is a credibility problem no caption can talk its way out of.
 * Client 360's "Cash Under Advice" card owns that number.
