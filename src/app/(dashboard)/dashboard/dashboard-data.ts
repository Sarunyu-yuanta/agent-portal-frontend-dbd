/**
 * What the Dashboard derives, kept out of the components that draw it.
 *
 * ─── Why this page exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every other section is organised by its own subject — Client 360 by client,
 * Product Catalog by product category, Insights by the period a view was
 * published in. None of them is organised by *today*, and the one axis in the
 * app that is (`../notification-zones`) had exactly one reader: the header
 * bell, a popover that closes the moment you click anything in it.
 *
 * So this file does two things the rest of the app leaves undone:
 *
 * 1. **Merges the three feeds that own an RM's morning** — KYC expiries,
 *    reminders, and desk-raised alerts — onto that shared urgency axis, so they
 *    can be worked through as one list instead of three surfaces.
 * 2. **Joins the axes that already have a bridge in the data but no screen
 *    using it** — a house view to the products it points at, a client to the
 *    advisory account they don't have yet.
 *
 * ─── Backend handoff ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing new is mocked here. Every input is a dataset that already exists
 * (`@/lib/mock-data`, the notes context, the calendar's alert stand-in), so
 * pointing those at real endpoints lights this page up with them.
