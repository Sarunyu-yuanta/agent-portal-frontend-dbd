/**
 * Which products can be booked, and how an id turns back into one.
 *
 * ─── Scope ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Four desks, in two booking modes (see {@link BookingMode}):
 *
 * - **basket** — Global Structured (`/product-catalog/product/:id`) and Thai
 *   Structured (`/product-catalog/thai-structured/:theme`). Bookings fill a
 *   notional target and go downstream as one order; the product is then done.
 * - **quota** — Fixed Income (`fi-`) and Global Bond (`gb-`). Each booking is
 *   sent as its own order straight away; the product closes when its issue
 *   quota is used up.
 *
 * Stocks, TFEX and mutual funds are not booked at all — Order Management shows
 * their client transactions instead (`use-transactions.ts`).
 *
 * Adding a desk is this file plus a CTA on that desk's detail page.
 *
 * ─── One namespace ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `/orders/:id` is a single route for every desk, so their ids have to be
 * distinguishable. The global desk's are authored (`ko-wmt`,
 * `sp-nvda-amzn-axp`); the others are derived and carry a prefix — `thai-`,
 * `fi-`, `gb-` — which is what {@link findBookableProduct} splits on.
