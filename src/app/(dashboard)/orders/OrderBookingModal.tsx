/**
 * The booking form: pick the customer, read their four statuses back, enter the
 * notional, book.
 *
 * ## One screen, with the amount gated in place
 *
 * The amount used to be a second step behind `ถัดไป`. It is back on the same
 * screen as the checks, so the IC sees the whole order at once — but it is
 * **disabled until all four pass**, faded rather than hidden, so the reader can
 * see what comes next and that it is not yet open to them. That keeps what the
 * step bought (no typing an amount for a client who cannot buy) without the
 * extra click.
 *
 * The primary button — `จองซื้อ` on a basket, `ส่งคำสั่งซื้อ` on a bond, see
 * {@link ORDER_WORDS} — still re-checks readiness rather than trusting the
 * faded section: a
 * check can expire while the form is open. A client who is missing something is
 * fixed in the system that owns the record, which is where
 * "ส่งให้ลูกค้าดำเนินการ" sends them — the form has no override.

          padded scroller meant cancelling the padding with a negative margin.
          That pair has to match at every breakpoint, and it did not: the block
          ended up 8px further in than the list below it. Padding the panes
          instead means there is no pair to keep in step.

          `overflow-x-hidden` here rather than on the track below, which is what

            They are one strip that slides rather than two views that swap: the

            beside a form whose later steps are hidden (short), that was ~300px
            of blank scroll under the form.

            `clip` rather than `hidden`: `hidden` would make this the scrollport
            the picker's sticky search header sticks to, and this box never
            scrolls — the header would have scrolled away with its rows. A
