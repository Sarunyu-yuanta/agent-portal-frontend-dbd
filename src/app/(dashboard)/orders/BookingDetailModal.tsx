 * One booking, opened from its row in a product's Order Management tab.

 * Built from the same receipt pieces as `TransactionDetailModal`
 * (`detail-sheet-ui`): where the booking stands as a disc and a coloured
 * heading, the product named under it, then a grey panel of label-left /
 * value-right rows ending at the notional. The four checks keep their own
 * cards below — they are a group being scanned, not facts being read off.
 *
 * It used to mirror the booking *form* instead, field for field, on the
 * reasoning that the IC should read it the way they wrote it. What that
 * actually produced was eight label/value pairs of equal weight for something
 * whose first question is only ever "did this go through".
