/**
 * A desk's orders, **one row per record** — the layout all seven of Order
 * Management's tabs now share.
 *
 * It has been two other shapes. One row per *product* was the shape the data is
 * stored in, and an IC had to read the list end to end to answer "what has this
 * client got". One row per *client*, with an accordion onto their records,
 * fixed that but bought a different problem: every column had to describe a
 * group. "ยอดรวม" summed currencies, "สถานะ" became a row of counted tags that
 * ran to three or four colours at once, and reaching an actual record took two
 * clicks.
 *
 * A record is what the IC acts on, so a record is the row — the same shape
 * `TransactionsPanel` lists stock, TFEX and mutual fund trades in, which is
 * what makes all seven tabs read the same way. Clicking one opens
 * `BookingDetailModal`, its own receipt, over the list rather than away from it.
 *
 * **Two kinds of record, one list.** A booking, and an offer that has produced
 * no booking yet (`openOffersFor`). The offer row carries no amount — nothing
 * has been committed — and opens its own receipt (`ProposalDetailModal`)
 * rather than the booking's, because there is no booking behind it.
 *
 * **Only this IC's own clients.** A basket is shared across the desk: the book
 * for one product holds every IC's bookings, and its notional is the whole
 * desk's. An IC reading a basket was reading other people's clients, which is
 * why this list exists — so it keeps only what `createdBy` says is theirs. The
 * product page's Order tab is the opposite scope, and deliberately.
 *
 * **What a row cannot say**, and does not try to: how full a book is, as a
 * figure of its own. The fill belongs to a deal, not to one person's record of
 * it, so it sits as a quiet line under the product rather than in a column
 * about the record.
