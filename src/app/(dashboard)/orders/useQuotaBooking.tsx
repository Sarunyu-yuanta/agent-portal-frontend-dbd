/**
 * Ordering a bond from a catalogue page — Fixed Income or Global Bond.
 *
 * One press is the whole flow here: a bond has nothing to fill, so the order is
 * created and sent in the same action (`placeOrder` in `contexts/orders-context`)
 * and the IC has nothing left to do with it. The structured desks order from a
 * product page with its own Order tab to land on; a bond is ordered from a list
 * row as often as from its own page, and a list has no tab to switch to, so the
 * hand-off is a toast instead — the modal's "ส่งคำสั่งซื้อ … แล้ว" quotes the
 * reference and carries a "ดูคำสั่งซื้อ" action to Order Management.
 *
 * One hook per page rather than one modal per row: a table of bonds would
 * otherwise mount a modal and a toast stack for every line.
