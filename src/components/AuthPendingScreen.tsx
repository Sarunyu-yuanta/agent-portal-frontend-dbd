/**
 * Full-bleed brand splash covering the auth screens while a sign-in attempt is
 * in flight (Figma `Desktop - 1`, node `30:66`). The gradient angle/stops come
 * straight from the design.
 *
 * Two deliberate departures from the node: the lockup renders at 320px rather
 * than the designed 423px, and it breathes (see `--animate-breathe` in
 * `globals.css`) so the screen reads as working rather than as a static brand
 * card. The animation lives on the lockup instead of a separate spinner so
 * nothing displaces the design's dead-centre placement.
 *
 * It overlays rather than replaces the form so the credentials the user typed
 * survive a navigation that never lands, and it fades in at the same 200ms as
 * `FadeIn` so an instant client-side push doesn't strobe the screen blue.
