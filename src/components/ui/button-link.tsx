/**
 * A `<Link>` wearing `Button`'s clothes.
 *
 * `Button` from `@sarunyu/system-one` is a plain `<button>` with no `asChild`
 * or `render` escape hatch, so an action that *navigates* has to choose between
 * the design system's look and the browser's behaviour — a `<button>` calling
 * `router.push` costs middle-click, ⌘-click and "open in new tab", and an
 * `<a>` styled by hand drifts from the real buttons beside it.
 *
 * The Dashboard cards hit this first and answered it with two hand-rolled
 * constants (`CARD_LINK_CLASS` and `CARD_BUTTON_CLASS` in
 * `dashboard/CardHeader`). This is the same answer generalised, for surfaces
 * that need more than those two shapes; those constants stay where they are
 * because the pixels they produce are already shipped.
 *
 * The class strings below are lifted from `Button`'s own `getVariantClasses`
 * and size maps. **If the design system's button changes, these follow it.**
