/**
 * The header bell, in place of the DS `NavHeaderNotification`.
 *
 * Written here for one reason: the installed DS build declares
 * `NotificationGroup.label` but only ever uses it as a React key — it paints no
 * heading and no divider (checked its compiled source). Its panel is therefore
 * always one flat list, and the only way the app had to show which day a row
 * belongs to was to repeat the label inside every row's own `time` line, which
 * is where a timestamp goes and read as one.
 *
 * The trigger, panel and row shapes are kept to the DS's own measurements —
 * 24px glyph, 375px panel, 480px scroll cap, 40px icon column, `text-base`
 * title over `text-sm` description — so this reads as the same component with
 * the group headings the type always promised.
 *
 * ## One list, newest day first
 *
 * The panel lists what is already due and nothing else, dated by day: today,
 * then yesterday, then "2 วันก่อน" and back, running down the panel. Nothing
 * still ahead is shown. An earlier version put "กำลังจะถึง" and "เลยกำหนด"
 * behind counted rows above the list; "overdue" as one lump also hid how long
 * ago each thing was, which the day headings now say.

   * the whole panel reading as new forever.
