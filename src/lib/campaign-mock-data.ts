/**
 * Promotions and events, with every date stamped from today.
 *
 * `campaigns.json` carries **day offsets** (`startOffset`, `endOffset`,
 * `eventOffset`) rather than literal dates, and this turns them into the
 * `startDate` / `endDate` / `eventDate` every consumer reads. Same reason
 * `mockKYCData` inverts the relationship for KYC reviews:
 *
 * 1. Authored dates rot. A fixture written as "ends 2026-10-20" is an expired
 *    campaign by November, and the whole surface — the countdown badge, the
 *    "โปรที่ใช้ได้" count, the greyed-out "หมดเขต" card — stops demonstrating
 *    anything but the ended state.
 * 2. The states only exist if some campaign is actually sitting in each one.
 *    The spread in the JSON keeps one promotion ending inside seven days, one
 *    not yet open, one closed, one event full and one already held — next month
 *    as much as today.
 *
 * Only the mock inverts it. `startDate` / `endDate` stay the fields of record,
 * so `campaign-data`'s arithmetic behaves exactly as it will against a backend
 * that returns dates.
 *
 * ─── Backend handoff ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The seeds below are the *starting* state. Everything the IC then does —
 * sharing, registering, marking attendance — is held in
 * `contexts/campaigns-context`, which is where the endpoints go.
