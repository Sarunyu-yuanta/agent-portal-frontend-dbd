/**
 * Risk & compliance findings, with every date stamped at import.
 *
 * `risk-alerts.json` carries **offsets** rather than literal dates, for the
 * reason `campaign-mock-data` and `mockKYCData` both give: authored dates rot,
 * and the urgency bands the UI is built to show — overdue, today, tomorrow,
 * this week — only exist if some row is actually sitting in each one. The
 * spread in the JSON keeps demonstrating them next month as much as today.
 *
 * Two offsets, in two units, because they are two different kinds of fact:
 * `dueOffset` is in **days** (a deadline is a date someone set), while
 * `detectedMinutesAgo` is in **elapsed minutes** (a detection is a span). See
 * {@link timestampFromMinutesAgo} for what that distinction cost to learn.
 *
 * Only the mock inverts it. `dueDate` stays the field of record and `daysLeft`
 * is computed back out of it, so the arithmetic every consumer runs is the
 * arithmetic it will run against a backend that returns a date.
 *
 * ─── Backend handoff ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * These rows are what the firm's margin, AML and surveillance engines would
 * push. What the *IC* then does with one — acknowledging it — is not here; it
 * is a user preference, held through `useStoredIds`. See
 * `app/(dashboard)/command-center/risk-feed`.

 * detectedTime: "12:05" }` and a clamp to `now`, so an alert "from midday"
 * would not read as detected in the future at a nine-in-the-morning demo.
 *
 * Both halves of that were wrong:
 *
 * - **The clamp was a hydration bug.** It collapsed every still-future row onto
 *   the same instant, so a server rendering at 08:00 and a client hydrating at
 *   12:06 disagreed about which findings were newest — enough to reorder the
 *   card and fail hydration outright.
 * - **The clock time was the wrong unit.** Dropping the clamp only moved the
 *   problem: a demo at 08:00 showed two criticals as "เมื่อสักครู่" because
 *   09:12 and 12:05 had not happened yet. No absolute time fixes that, since
 *   the demo can run at any hour. What the fixture always meant was "this fired
 *   about three hours ago", so that is what it now says.
 *
 * Unlike `dueDate`, this is deliberately *not* anchored to the calendar day.
 * A deadline is a date someone set and the arithmetic against it has to match a
 * real backend's; a detection is an elapsed interval, and the span is the fact
 * worth keeping stable across a demo that might run at any hour.
 *
 * Server and client evaluate this module at different instants, so every stamp
 * shifts by that delta — but all of them shift by the *same* delta, so the
 * ordering the sort depends on is identical either side. Only the rendered
 * label can differ, which is why that span carries `suppressHydrationWarning`.
