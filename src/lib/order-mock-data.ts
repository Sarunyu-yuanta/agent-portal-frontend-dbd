 * ─── Backend handoff ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing here is authored as a timestamp. Every seed carries `daysAgo`, and
 * the date is stamped from today at import — the same inversion `mockKYCData`
 * does, for the same reason: a literal date in a fixture is wrong the week
 * after it is written, and a demo whose "2 days ago" reads "8 months ago" is
 * worse than no demo. A real backend returns real timestamps and these consumers
 * don't change.
 *
 * Product-level facts (currency, notional target, minimum ticket) are
 * deliberately *not* here. They belong to the product, and reading them from
 * the catalogue rather than copying them into a fixture is what stops a book
 * from quoting a target the product itself doesn't have — see
 * `app/(dashboard)/orders/order-book.ts`, which assembles the two.
