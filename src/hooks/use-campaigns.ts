/**
 * The read side of Promotions & Events.
 *
 * Same seam as `@/hooks/use-api` and `@/hooks/use-catalog`: the fixtures ship
 * in the bundle, so these hand them back through {@link useStatic}, and the
 * list page already renders its skeleton against the `isLoading` that comes
 * out. Giving campaigns a real endpoint is a change in this file.
 *
 * The *write* side — who has been sent what, who is registered — is
 * `@/contexts/campaigns-context`, for the reason `OrdersProvider` exists: a
 * share sent from a detail page has to move the KPI strip on the list without
 * either screen remounting.
