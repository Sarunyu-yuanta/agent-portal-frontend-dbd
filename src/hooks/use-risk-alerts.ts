/**
 * The read side of Risk & Compliance alerts.
 *
 * Same seam as `@/hooks/use-api`, `@/hooks/use-catalog` and
 * `@/hooks/use-campaigns`: the fixtures ship in the bundle, so this hands them
 * back through {@link useStatic}, and both surfaces already render skeletons
 * against the `isLoading` that comes out. Giving risk alerts a real endpoint is
 * a change in this file.
 *
 * Its own module rather than a fifth entry in `@/hooks/use-api`, which says of
 * itself that it holds the datasets the dashboard *shell* needs. These are a
 * feature's, and putting them there would also have `use-api` importing
 * `risk-mock-data`, which imports `mock-data` — the cycle `use-catalog` and
 * `use-campaigns` avoid by living apart.
 *
 * What the IC has *acknowledged* is not here. That is a user preference, not a
 * property of the finding — see `command-center/risk-feed` and
 * `command-center/use-risk-alert-rows`.
