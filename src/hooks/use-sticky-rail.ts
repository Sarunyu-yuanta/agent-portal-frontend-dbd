/**
 * Where a sticky side rail should pin, measured rather than guessed.
 *
 * A sticky box holds in one direction only, and `top` is the one that keeps a
 * column in place while the content beside it scrolls on. But a fixed `top`
 * pins the rail the instant you scroll, and a rail taller than the viewport
 * then has its last card parked below the fold for good.
 *
 * Everything below is in one coordinate space: the offsets Blink resolves a
 * sticky `top` against are insets from the scroll container's *content* box,
 * not from the visible edge under the app's top bar — the Calendar's sticky tab
 * strip had to learn the same thing, and pays for it with `xl:-top-6`. So `0`
 * is where a rail already stands in normal flow, one page-padding below the top
 * bar, and `contentHeight − rail` is where its last card lands on the line the
 * work column ends on.
 *
 * `contentHeight − rail` is the right offset only while the rail is the taller
 * of the two — negative, so the rail scrolls along until that card arrives.
 *
 * Positive is where it goes wrong. A sticky box holds itself *down* to its
 * `top` as much as up, so a rail shorter than the content area gets pushed that
 * far down the column, opening a gutter above its first card on exactly the
 * screens with the most room to show it — tall and wide, nothing scrolled yet.
 * Hence the clamp, and the two cases meet continuously: at the height where the
 * rail exactly fills the content area, both terms are equal.
 *
 * It has to be measured because CSS has no term for "this element's own height"
 * inside `top` — `100%` there resolves against the containing block.
 *
 * The clamp is the rail's *own* offset in that content box rather than a flat
 * `0`, which is what lets one hook serve two different pages. On the Dashboard
 * the rail starts at the content box's top, so the clamp works out to `0` and
 * it pins where it stands. On a client's profile a sticky identity bar sits
 * above it, so the rail starts further down — and the clamp lands it back in
 * exactly that spot, under the bar rather than behind it, with no nudge as it
 * goes from flowing to pinned. Measured through `offsetTop`, which reports the
 * laid-out position and so is not itself moved by the sticky offset it feeds.
 *
 * `undefined` until the first measurement, so the attribute is simply absent
 * rather than briefly wrong; the rail is in normal flow for that one frame.
 *
 * @typeParam T the rail's own element type. Defaults to `HTMLElement`, which
 * suits an `<aside>`; a caller putting the ref on a `<div>` names it so that
 * `railRef` lands on `ref` without a cast.

     * The rail's flowed top, as an inset from the scrollport's content box —

     * That last part is the whole trick. Blink folds the sticky shift *into*
     * `offsetTop` and `getBoundingClientRect`, so measuring a pinned rail and
     * feeding the result back into its `top` is a loop that walks the rail down
     * the page a little further on every pass (176 → 199 → 312 here). Blanking
     * `top` first drops the rail to where layout actually put it; the value is
     * read, and the next render restores the offset.
     *
     * `+ scrollTop` converts the viewport-relative reading into a scroll
     * independent one, so the same number comes back at any scroll position.
