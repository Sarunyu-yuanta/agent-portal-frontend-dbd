/**
 * The handler for an in-page back button: goes **up one level** along the
 * breadcrumb trail, not back through browser history.
 *
 * The two differ whenever the user reached this page from outside its section —
 * opening a bond detail from Client 360, or resuming into one from the sidebar.
 * `router.back()` would leave the section entirely; the trail keeps them inside
 * it, which is what a breadcrumb-shaped back button promises.
 *
 * Always pushes rather than rewinding through browser history: our own trail
 * is the source of truth for "one level up," and it can legitimately disagree
 * with the browser's real history stack — a sidebar smart-resume, a manual
 * browser back/forward, or a `replace()` elsewhere all change what's actually
 * behind this page without changing what our trail says is *above* it. Relying
 * on `router.back()` whenever the two happened to match previously meant a
 * single mismatch (say, a stale `previousVisit()`) could send the user
 * somewhere our own trail never pointed at — pushing our own computed target
 * is what makes the button keep the promise its breadcrumb makes.
 *
 * @param getFallback Overrides {@link sectionRoot} for the cold-entry case.
 *   Called at click time, since resolving it may read storage.
